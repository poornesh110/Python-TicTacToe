# Python-TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe Python project using pygame library.
Pygame is a great library that will allow us to create the window and draw images and shapes on the window. This way we will capture mouse coordinates and identify the block where we need to mark ‘X’ or ‘O’. Then we will check if the user wins the game or not.
# Description
Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. If you don’t know how to play this game don’t worry let us first understand that.
The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.
# Prerequisites
To implement this game, we will use the basic concepts of Python and Pygame which is a Python library for building cross-platform games. It contains the modules needed for computer graphics and sound libraries. To install the library, you can use pip installer from the command line:
----------pip install pygame--------------
Execute the code and play the game starting with X as Player 1 and O as Player 2.
